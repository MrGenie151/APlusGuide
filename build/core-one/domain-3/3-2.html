            <h1>3.2 Installing RAM and different RAM types</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>RAM (Random-Access Memory) is a form of memory for computers to read and store data in any order temporarily. It is typically used to store working data and machine code.</p>
<p>Not all RAM look the same however. Different types of RAM exist for different systems. For example, SODIMMs are the type of RAM commonly found in laptops for their small form factor.
Different types of RAM can be told apart by their shape and notch position.</p>
